## Note:

### 11_basic-types.go, 12_zero.go

`fmt.Printf("%v %v %v %q\n", i, f, b, s)`

`%v` and `%q` are 'verbs' formatted by 'package fmt'.

%v: the value in a default format

%q: a single-quoted character literal safely escaped with Go syntax.

%T: a Go-syntax representation of the type of the value

For more details, see [https://golang.org > Packages > fmt](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/) .
